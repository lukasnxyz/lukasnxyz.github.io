This is a list of things I've read that had an impact on me (at any level).

- [How To Be An Exprt In A Changing World - Paul Graham](https://www.paulgraham.com/ecw.html#f1n): Be hyper
    sensative to the winds of chnage because you can't predict the future, but you can try and go in the best
    direction by probing all directions first. Ie. always be open for everything and do as much as possible
    early on in what ever you're doing.
